<<doc-def "Reference tiddlers">> offer raw information in a comprehensive interlinked way. The reader is likely to be an intermediate or expert user.

There are several subcategories:

;Concepts
* With definitions, together forming a glossary

;User manual
* Presenting technical details of ~WikiText features
* Subcategorised: messages, operators, widgets, etc

;Developer manual
* Presenting technical details of ~TiddlyWiki's internal architecture

Reference material is written in a terse, formal style that avoids referring to the reader, and instead focuses on how ~TiddlyWiki itself behaves. The passive voice is often suitable:

* <<doc-w "the template is specified as a tiddler">> rather than <<doc-w "specify the template as a tiddler">>
* <<doc-w "the widget can be used for various purposes">> rather than <<doc-w "you can use the widget for various purposes">>
* But <<doc-w "this widget has several possible uses">> is better, because it is less convoluted and more succinct

Most contracted verb forms are avoided in reference tiddlers. But those ending in <<doc-w "n't">> (<<doc-w "aren't">>, <<doc-w "doesn't">>, <<doc-w "hasn't">>, <<doc-w "isn't">>, etc) are acceptable, as they make it less easy to accidentally overlook the word <<doc-w not>>.
