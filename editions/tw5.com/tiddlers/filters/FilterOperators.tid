A <<doc-def "filter operator">> is a predefined name attached to an individual step in a [[filter|Filters]]. It defines how that step is to be performed.

A typical step is written as `[operator[parameter]]`, although not all of the operators need a parameter.

Here are the most commonly used operators:

<<list-links "[tag[CommonFilters]]">>

The complete list is:

<<list-links "[tag[Filters]] -[[Introduction to filter notation]] -[[Filter Syntax]]">>
